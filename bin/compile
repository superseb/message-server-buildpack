# The compile script builds the droplet that will be run by the DEA and will 
# therefore contain all the components necessary to run the application.
#
# The script is run with two arguments, the build directory for the 
# application and the cache directory.
# 
# The build directory is the location that the compile script should lay out all 
# the servers, and frameworks into that are needed to run the application.  
#
# The cache directory is a location scoped to a single application that can be 
# used to cache assets so that subsequent builds of the same application will be 
# faster.  So if you push an app with the same app GUID (which is triggered by 
# pushing an app with the name of an app that already exists in a targeted 
# space), then the same cache directory that was used for the previous build 
# will be made available to the buildpack compile script for the new application 
# deployment.
# 
# During execution of this script all output sent to STDOUT will be relayed 
# via CF back to the end user. 
#
# The generally accepted pattern for a more complex compile script is to break 
# out functionality in to a 'language_pack'. A good example of this can be seen 
# at 
# https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-ruby/blob/master/lib/language_pack/ruby.rb

# This particular script will simply copy a hello-start.sh script file that 
# will be executed by Cloud Foundry at this application's startup.
